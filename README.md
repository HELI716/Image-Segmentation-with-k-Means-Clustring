# Image Segmentation using K-means Clustering

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the application of K-means clustering for image segmentation. The notebook provides a detailed explanation and implementation of the K-means algorithm to segment different regions of an image based on their color intensities.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Installation
To run this notebook:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed. If not, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:


## Usage
Follow the instructions within the notebook to perform image segmentation on the provided sample images. You can also replace the sample images with your own to see how the algorithm segments different images.
